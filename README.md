# Scuffazon

## Inspiration
Based on the theme of this hackathon,  we want to implement some real-world stuff but in a scuffed way. So we choose a eCommerce website.

## What it does
It sells meme, you can buy it using your dogecoin.

## How we built it
Make sure have Node.js installed, `npm i`
then `ng serve -o`

## Challenges we ran into
Some of teammates may not familiar with this front-end framework, but they learn it during this hackathon.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Overall the team collaborate is good.

## What's next for Scuffazon
Based on the existing structure and components, we can write a back-end for it and easily integrate the front end and back end. We can also implement some payment system.
